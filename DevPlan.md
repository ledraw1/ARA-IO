# ARA-IO Development Plan

This document breaks down the implementation of the ARA Region Context Manager into discrete, testable stories using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Gherkin syntax.

## Epic 1: Region Discovery and Display

### Story 1.1: Basic Region Metadata Fetching
```gherkin
Feature: Fetch Region Metadata
  As a plugin developer
  I want to fetch metadata for all regions in a track
  So that I can display them in the plugin GUI

  Background:
    Given the plugin is loaded in a DAW
    And the DAW has ARA support enabled

  Scenario: Fetch metadata for a single region
    Given there is one region in the track
    When the plugin queries for available regions
    Then it should receive the region's metadata including:
      | Property    | Type     |
      | Name/ID     | String   |
      | Start Time  | Double   |
      | End Time    | Double   |
      | Audio Source| String   |

  Scenario: Fetch metadata for multiple regions
    Given there are multiple regions in the track
    When the plugin queries for available regions
    Then it should receive metadata for all regions
    And the regions should be ordered by their start time
```

### Story 1.2: Region List Display
```gherkin
Feature: Display Region List
  As a user
  I want to see a list of all regions in my track
  So that I can understand their organization

  Background:
    Given the plugin is loaded in a DAW
    And there are regions in the track

  Scenario: Display region list in GUI
    When the plugin window is opened
    Then I should see a table containing all regions
    And each row should display:
      | Column      | Description          |
      | Name/ID     | Region identifier    |
      | Start Time  | In bars/beats        |
      | End Time    | In bars/beats        |
      | Controller  | Current controller   |

  Scenario: Update display when regions change
    When a new region is added to the track
    Then the table should update automatically
    And the new region should appear in the list
```

## Epic 2: Region Control Management

### Story 2.1: Query Region Control State
```gherkin
Feature: Query Region Control State
  As a plugin
  I want to know who controls each region
  So that I can display accurate control information

  Scenario: Query control state of uncontrolled region
    Given a region exists in the track
    And no plugin has control of the region
    When I query the region's control state
    Then it should indicate the DAW is in control

  Scenario: Query control state of controlled region
    Given a region exists in the track
    And another plugin has control of the region
    When I query the region's control state
    Then it should indicate which plugin has control
```

### Story 2.2: Request Region Control
```gherkin
Feature: Request Region Control
  As a user
  I want to request control over regions
  So that I can manage their playback

  Scenario: Successfully request control
    Given a region is not controlled by any plugin
    When I click the "Request Control" button for that region
    Then the plugin should gain control of the region
    And the GUI should update to show my plugin as controller

  Scenario: Failed control request
    Given a region is controlled by another plugin
    When I click the "Request Control" button for that region
    Then the request should fail gracefully
    And the GUI should display an error message
```

### Story 2.3: Release Region Control
```gherkin
Feature: Release Region Control
  As a user
  I want to release control of regions
  So that other plugins can control them

  Scenario: Release controlled region
    Given a region is controlled by my plugin
    When I click the "Release Control" button
    Then the plugin should release control
    And the GUI should update to show DAW as controller

  Scenario: Release uncontrolled region
    Given a region is not controlled by my plugin
    When I click the "Release Control" button
    Then nothing should happen
    And the GUI should not change
```

## Epic 3: Dynamic Updates and State Management

### Story 3.1: Region Change Notifications
```gherkin
Feature: Region Change Notifications
  As a plugin
  I want to receive notifications about region changes
  So that I can keep the GUI in sync

  Scenario: New region added
    When a new region is added to the track
    Then the plugin should receive a notification
    And update the GUI with the new region

  Scenario: Region removed
    When a region is removed from the track
    Then the plugin should receive a notification
    And remove that region from the GUI

  Scenario: Region modified
    When a region's properties are changed
    Then the plugin should receive a notification
    And update the GUI with the new properties
```

### Story 3.2: Control State Change Notifications
```gherkin
Feature: Control State Change Notifications
  As a plugin
  I want to receive notifications about control state changes
  So that I can keep the GUI in sync

  Scenario: Another plugin takes control
    Given my plugin is displaying a region's state
    When another plugin takes control of the region
    Then my plugin should receive a notification
    And update the GUI to show the new controller

  Scenario: Plugin releases control
    Given my plugin is displaying a region's state
    When the controlling plugin releases control
    Then my plugin should receive a notification
    And update the GUI to show DAW control
```

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Strategy
1. Create mock ARA host for unit testing
2. Use JUCE's unit testing framework
3. Implement test doubles for:
   - ARA Playback Regions
   - ARA Model Update Controller
   - ARA Host Model
4. Test GUI components using JUCE's component testing utilities

### Dependencies
- JUCE Framework (Version 8)
- ARA SDK (Version 2.2.0)
- C++17 or later
- Unit Testing Framework: JUCE's built-in framework

### Development Order
1. Implement core ARA integration (Epic 1)
2. Build basic GUI components (Story 1.2)
3. Add control management features (Epic 2)
4. Implement dynamic updates (Epic 3)
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Polish GUI and user experience
